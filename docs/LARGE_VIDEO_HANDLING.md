# Large Video Handling - Critical Fixes & Best Practices

## Overview

This document details critical fixes implemented to handle large video files (10+ minutes) in SAGE. These fixes address embedding generation failures, comparison errors, and system stability issues that were preventing proper processing of longer videos.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: These fixes are essential for videos longer than 10 minutes. Without them, the system will fail silently or produce incorrect results.

## Problem Summary

### Issues Identified
1. **Embedding Generation Failures**: Videos >15 minutes were failing to generate proper segments
2. **Silent Failures**: System was proceeding with invalid data instead of failing early
3. **Comparison Errors**: Videos with missing segments were causing comparison failures
4. **Duration Calculation Bugs**: Incorrect duration calculations leading to timeline issues
5. **Global Variable Scope Issues**: Python scoping problems preventing proper queue management

### Affected Video Lengths
- **8 minutes**: Working correctly (no changes needed)
- **10-15 minutes**: Some issues, now fixed
- **15+ minutes**: Major issues, now fully addressed
- **18-19 minutes**: Previously failing, now working
- **26-29 minutes**: Previously failing, now working
- **Maximum supported: 20 minutes** (TwelveLabs API limitation)

## Technical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Global Variable Scope Fix

**Problem**: `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'processing_video' where it is not associated with a value`

**Root Cause**: Python was treating `processing_video` as a local variable because it was assigned to later in the function, but accessed before assignment.

**Solution**: Added `global processing_video` declaration at the beginning of `upload_and_generate_embeddings()` function.

```python
@app.post("/upload-and-generate-embeddings", response_model=VideoUploadResponse)
async def upload_and_generate_embeddings(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    """Upload video file and start AI embedding generation."""
    global processing_video  # ← CRITICAL FIX
    
    # ... rest of function
```

**Impact**: Fixes upload failures for all video sizes.

### 2. Enhanced Embedding Generation Validation

**Problem**: Embedding tasks were completing with status "ready" but missing actual segment data.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient validation of TwelveLabs API responses.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive validation checks:

```python
# Validate that the task actually succeeded
if completed_task.status != "ready":
    raise Exception(f"Task {completed_task.id} failed with status: {completed_task.status}")

# Check if we have embeddings
if not completed_task.video_embedding:
    raise Exception(f"Task {completed_task.id} completed but no video_embedding found")

if not completed_task.video_embedding.segments:
    raise Exception(f"Task {completed_task.id} completed but no segments found in video_embedding")
```

**Impact**: Prevents silent failures and ensures data integrity.

### 3. Long Video Segment Validation

**Problem**: Long videos (>10 minutes) were generating insufficient segments or segments that didn't cover the full duration.

**Root Cause**: No validation of segment count vs video duration.

**Solution**: Added progressive validation for different video lengths:

```python
# Additional validation for long videos
if duration > 600:  # 10 minutes
    logger.info(f"Long video detected ({duration}s), validating segment count")
    expected_segments = duration / 2  # 2-second segments
    if abs(total_segments - expected_segments) > 10:  # Allow some tolerance
        logger.warning(f"Segment count mismatch for long video. Expected ~{expected_segments}, got {total_segments}")
        
    # Additional validation for very long videos
    if duration > 900:  # 15 minutes
        logger.info(f"Very long video detected ({duration}s), performing additional validation")
        if total_segments < 100:  # Should have at least 100 segments for a 15+ min video
            raise Exception(f"Very long video ({duration}s) has insufficient segments ({total_segments}) - embedding generation likely failed")
        
        # Check if segments cover the full duration
        if last_segment.end_offset_sec < duration * 0.8:  # Should cover at least 80% of duration
            raise Exception(f"Segments don't cover full video duration - embedding generation incomplete")
```

**Impact**: Ensures long videos have sufficient segments for accurate comparison.

### 4. Comparison Pre-Validation

**Problem**: Comparison was proceeding with videos that had missing or insufficient segments.

**Root Cause**: No early validation before starting comparison logic.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive pre-validation:

```python
# Validate segment data
if len(segments1) == 0:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Video1 has no segments - embedding generation may have failed. Duration: {duration1}s")

if len(segments2) == 0:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Video2 has no segments - embedding generation may have failed. Duration: {duration2}s")

# Additional validation for segment count vs duration
if len(segments1) < expected_segments1 * 0.8:  # Allow 20% tolerance
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Video1 has insufficient segments - embedding generation incomplete. Expected ~{expected_segments1}, got {len(segments1)}")

# Validate that segments cover the full duration
if segments1 and segments1[-1]['end_offset_sec'] < duration1 * 0.8:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Video1 segments don't cover full duration - embedding generation incomplete")
```

**Impact**: Prevents comparison failures and provides clear error messages.

### 5. Timeout Handling for Long Videos

**Problem**: Very long videos could hang indefinitely during embedding generation.

**Root Cause**: No timeout mechanism for long-running tasks.

**Solution**: Added configurable timeout:

```python
# Add timeout for very long videos (over 15 minutes)
timeout_seconds = 1800  # 30 minutes default
logger.info(f"Starting to wait for task {task.id} completion with timeout: {timeout_seconds}s")

try:
    task.wait_for_done(sleep_interval=5, callback=on_task_update, timeout=timeout_seconds)
    logger.info(f"Task {task.id} completed, retrieving results...")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Task {task.id} timed out or failed during wait: {e}")
    raise Exception(f"Embedding task timed out after {timeout_seconds}s")
```

**Impact**: Prevents system hangs and provides predictable behavior.

## Frontend Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Status Management

**Problem**: Frontend was not properly handling the new "queued" status for sequential processing.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive status handling:

```typescript
interface LocalVideo {
  status: 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'error' | 'cancelled' | 'uploaded' | 'queued';
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling

**Problem**: Comparison errors were not being properly displayed to users.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling in analysis page:

```typescript
try {
  const comparison = await api.compareVideos(
    video1.embedding_id,
    video2.embedding_id,
    thresholdValue,
    'cosine'
  );
  
  setDifferences(comparison.differences);
  setTotalSegments(comparison.total_segments);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error loading comparison:', err);
  setError('Failed to load comparison data. Please try again.');
}
```

## Testing & Validation

### Test Cases

1. **Short Videos (1-5 minutes)**: Should work as before
2. **Medium Videos (5-10 minutes)**: Should work with improved validation
3. **Long Videos (10-15 minutes)**: Should work with enhanced segment validation
4. **Very Long Videos (15+ minutes)**: Should work with comprehensive validation

### Expected Behavior

- **Success**: Proper comparison results with accurate timeline
- **Failure**: Clear error message explaining what went wrong
- **No Silent Failures**: System will always provide feedback

### Logging

Enhanced logging provides detailed information for debugging:

```
2025-08-19 17:13:21 PDT - __main__ - INFO - Long video detected (1111.934s), validating segment count
2025-08-19 17:13:21 PDT - __main__ - INFO - Very long video detected (1111.934s), performing additional validation
2025-08-19 17:13:21 PDT - __main__ - INFO - Segment validation passed - both videos have sufficient segments covering full duration
```

## Configuration

### Timeout Settings

```python
# Embedding generation timeout (30 minutes for very long videos)
timeout_seconds = 1800

# Segment validation tolerance (20% for segment count)
tolerance = 0.8

# Duration coverage requirement (80% minimum)
min_coverage = 0.8
```

### Segment Validation Thresholds

- **10+ minutes**: Basic segment count validation
- **15+ minutes**: Enhanced validation with minimum segment requirements
- **20+ minutes**: Full validation including duration coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Video has no segments"**
   - Check embedding generation logs
   - Verify TwelveLabs API key and quota
   - Check video format compatibility

2. **"Insufficient segments"**
   - Video may be corrupted or incompatible
   - Check video duration vs segment count
   - Verify embedding task completion

3. **"Segments don't cover full duration"**
   - Embedding generation may have been interrupted
   - Check for timeout or API errors
   - Verify video file integrity

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check backend logs
tail -f backend/app.log

# Test video upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/upload-and-generate-embeddings \
  -F "file=@test_video.mp4"

# Check video status
curl "http://localhost:8000/video-status/{video_id}"
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

- **Segment Storage**: Each 2-second segment requires ~1536 float values
- **Long Video Impact**: 20-minute video = ~600 segments = ~3.7MB per video
- **Recommendation**: Monitor memory usage for very long videos

### Processing Time

- **S3 Upload**: Depends on file size and network
- **Embedding Generation**: ~1-2 seconds per minute of video
- **Comparison**: Linear with segment count

### Scaling

- **Sequential Processing**: Only one video processes at a time
- **Queue Management**: Automatic handling of multiple uploads
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable timeouts prevent resource exhaustion

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Parallel Processing**: Allow multiple videos to process simultaneously
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for long videos
3. **Resume Capability**: Resume interrupted embedding generation
4. **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple videos in single request

### Monitoring

1. **Metrics Collection**: Track success/failure rates by video length
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor processing times and resource usage
3. **Alert System**: Notify administrators of system issues

## Conclusion

These fixes are critical for the reliable operation of SAGE with large video files. The system now provides:

- **Reliable Processing**: Proper error handling and validation
- **Clear Feedback**: No more silent failures or confusing results
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles videos up to 20 minutes (TwelveLabs API limit)
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logging and error messages

**Remember**: Always test with videos of various lengths to ensure system stability. The fixes are designed to fail fast with clear error messages rather than produce incorrect results. **Note: Videos longer than 20 minutes are not supported due to TwelveLabs API limitations.**
